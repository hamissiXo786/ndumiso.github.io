                    <p>
                        This is a 4IR application which reduces congestion at the port by taking cognisance of the time
                        period the gantry crane takes to off load and pace a container on a truck, that cycle time
                        interval is then displayed to all the trucks scheduled for entry into the port so that they know
                        as to whether to arrive early or late because if there is a delay the cycle time changes and is
                        made transparent to all the trucks so that they act accordingly.</p>

                        The app is connected to google maps so you are able to get the precise geographical location of
                        the truck, the alternative routes possible as well as if there is traffic or not.</p>

                    <p>
                        The app comes with a built in feature that is connected to sensors in the engine compartment
                        with senses which monitor fuel usage, the speed of the truck as well as the overall peformance
                        of the truck.</p>

                    <p>
                        The app is able to communicate with similar devices on other trucks which ensures driver focus
                        on the route because a notification pops up on the device and the driver acknowledges it without
                        removing their hands of the steering wheel.
